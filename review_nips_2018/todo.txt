Reviewer 1:

1. Explain to him that this is indeed Bayesian model, we add Bayesianness to LISTA formulation, our model is Bayesian rather than deterministic. This should answer his 1 and 2 question in motivation/evaluation

2. Explain to him that there is one sort of sparsity. Spike and slab models a distribution of a Gaussian random vector after soft-thresholding non-linearity 

3. Explain to him difference between approximations in distributions in forward pass, which are part of the model and approximations in posterior in inference

4. Something on mutual independence over the elements of S and beta_{l-1}?


Reviewer 2:

1. Explain that the contribution in forward pass and how we extend the original probabilistic backpropagation

2. Check the first point on the experiments

3. Explain that the sparsity in MNIST experiments are in images themselves


Reviewer 3:

1. Say that we add more details on backpropagation

2. Check "the scalability of the proposed technique compared to classical backpropagation"

3. Explain him that we do not minimise "the loss", but rather do Bayesian inference

4. Check about alpha and lambda

5. Put words about why we have only limited number of cases for training
